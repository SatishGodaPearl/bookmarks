Description: # Browser: Maya Plug-In
        
        This plug-in is a Maya front-end to Browser, a custom PyQt pipeline package.
        Please note, this is a development release, and I can take no warranty for any of the functionality.
        
        ## Description
        The plug-in is responsible for setting Maya projects and importing, opening, referencing,
        and annotating projects and scenes.  
        Once installed and loaded, the browser window can be found in Maya's 'File'
        menu.  
        The application-wide shortcut to show the panel is 'Ctrl + Shift + O'.
        
        ##  Plug-in Installation
        
        Place `browserPlugin.py` into one of the Maya plug-in directories.
        The list of plug-in directories can be retrieved by running the following in
        the Maya Script Editor:
        
        ```python
        import os
        for path in os.environ['MAYA_PLUG_IN_PATH'].split(';'):
            print path
        ```
        
        By default, on windows, the default user plug-in paths are `C:/Users/[user name]/Documents/maya/[version]/plug-ins` and  `C:/Users/[user name]/Documents/maya/plug-ins`
        
        Sometimes, these directories don't exists so make sure you create them if so.
        Finally, you have to load the plug-in via the *Plug-in Manager*, it should be listed as `browserPlugin.py`.
        
        ## Python package installation
        Before loading the plug-in make sure the main 'Browser' module location is either added to the python path or placed in one of the python script directories. You can get them by running:
        
        ```python
        import sys
        for path in sys.path:
            print path
        ```
        
        By default, on windows, the default user script paths are `C:/Users/[user name]/Documents/maya/[version]/scripts` and  `C:/Users/[user name]/Documents/maya/scripts`
        
        After copying, you can test by your setup by trying to import `browser`
        to Maya. Run this in the Maya Script Editor:
        
        ```python
        import gwbrowser
        ```
        
        If you get any error messages something went south, no message is good.
