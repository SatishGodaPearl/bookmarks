An important aspect of GWBrowser is to allow adding descriptions and thumbnails,
and marking items as *favourites* and *archived*.

.. note::
   Descriptions, thumbnails and comments are visible to everyone using the same
   bookmark, as is marking an item **archived** |active|.

   Marking an item **favourite** |favourite|, however is local to the current
   user.

   All data is stored in a folder called ``.browser`` located in the root of the
   bookmark folder.


Much like bookmarks, assets can be annotated, marked as favourites or archived.
Because most pipelines are non-destructive deleting obsolete assets and files is
not possible. We can hide these items by clicking the small eye icon |active|.

.. tip::
   Marking something archived intended to mean the item is no longer used, eg.
   it is a depreciated shot or character rig. Marking a folder archived is only
   a visual garnish and in no way modifies the underlaying files.
