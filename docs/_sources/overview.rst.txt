Why bookmarks...?
=================

GWBrowser organizes projects into three parts: **bookmarks**, **assets** and
**files**. A folder containing one or more asset is considered a |bookmark|
**bookmark**.

Depending on your role, and how the project is structured, you likely will likely
need to interact with only the part of the project.

For instance, if you're a character modeller, some folders (eg. shots and
sequences) might not be of interest to you. In this case, you would bookmark the
folder where your model scenes reside allowing you to focus on the assets that
matter to you the most.

Adding jobs and bookmarks
=========================

Before you can add a bookmark GWBrowser must be told which servers to use.
You can define three a **primary**, **backup** and **local**
work folder.

With the ``bookmarks`` tab selected (``Ctrl+1``) click the small bookmark icon
|bookmark| or press ``Ctrl+N`` to show the dialogue used to add jobs and bookmarks.

If no jobs exist create a new one, otherwise select an
existing one from the dropdown menu.

.. note::
  The first time a job is created the **bookmark folders** won't contain any
  assets, and therefore GWBrowser can't list them. However, once at
  least one asset has been added to a bookmark folder, they will show up in the
  dropdown menu.

  See below to learn what constitutes a **bookmark folder**.

The **server, asset** and **bookmark folder** selections make up the final bookmark.
Once all three has been selected the bookmark can be added.

######
Assets
######

Every bookmark folder will contain a number of |asset| **assets**. These can be shots,
sequences, or generic containers. In technical terms, *assets* are simply
folders used to store texture, render, cache, scene (or any other files).

.. note::

  Assets have an *identifier file* in their root. Because GWBrowser uses
  the Maya project structure as reference this is a ``workspace.mel``
  file.

  When the *identifier file* resides in the root of a directory, GWBrowser will
  understand it as an *asset*, and the parent folder as a *bookmark folder*.

  This is what the relationship between bookmarks and assets look like:

  .. code-block:: javascript

    ./SHOTS/                <--- bookmark folder
    ├── .browser            <--- settings and thumbnails
    ├── SH000/
    │   ├── workspace.mel
    │   ├── scenes/         <--- a task folder
    │   ├── renders/        <--- another task folder
    │   └── textures/       <--- and you guessed, a task folder!
    ├── SH010/
    │   ├── workspace.mel
    │   ├── scenes/
    │   ├── renders/
    │   └── textures/
    └── SH020/
        ├── workspace.mel
        ├── scenes/
        ├── renders/
        └── textures/


Adding assets
=============

Select the ``assets`` tab (``Ctrl+2``) and click the small add icon |add|, or
press ``Ctrl+N`` to add a new asset.

  :alt: Assets...

The created asset will be placed in the root of the currently active
bookmark folder. If there's no active bookmark, you won't be able to add an asset.

.. tip::
   To activate a bookmark or asset, double-click it, or press enter when
   selected.

Customising the job and asset templates
=======================================

The template files defining the job and asset folders are located in the
``[username]/Documents/GWBrowser`` folder.

They are called **Asset.zip** and **Job.zip** respectively. You can replace them
with any other zip file (make sure to keep the same name).


###########
Annotations
###########

An important aspect of GWBrowser is to allow adding descriptions and thumbnails.

   :alt: Annotating items

.. note::
   Descriptions, thumbnails and comments are visible to everyone using the same
   bookmark, as is marking an item **archived** |active|.

   Marking an item **favourite** |favourite|, however is local to the current
   user.

   All data is stored in a folder called ``.browser`` located in the root of the
   bookmark folder.


Archiving items
===============

Much like bookmarks, assets can be annotated, marked as favourites or archived.
Because most pipelines are non-destructive deleting obsolete assets and files is
not possible or advised. We can hide these items by clicking the small eye icon
|active|.

  :alt: Assets...

.. tip::
   Marking something archived intended to mean the item is no longer used, eg.
   it is a depreciated shot or character rig. Marking a folder archived is only
   a visual garnish and in no way modifies the underlaying files.
