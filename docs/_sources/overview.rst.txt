Jobs, bookmarks and assets
===========================

GWBrowser organizes projects into three parts: **bookmarks**, **assets**
and **files**. A folder containing one or more *assets* is considered a |bookmark|
**bookmark**.


Adding a job and selecting a bookmark folder
---------------------------------------------

With the bookmarks tab selected (click `bookmarks`, or press ``Ctrl+1``) press
the small bookmark icon |bookmark| to add a new bookmark.

You will have to select the server, job and the root folder. These 3 selections
will make up the bookmark. You can also create the folder-structure for a new
job here by clicking the plus icon next to the job dropdown menu.

.. note::
   The first time a job is created the bookmark folders don't contain any assets,
   and therefore GWBrowser won't be able to find and list them. However,
   once at least one asset has been added to a bookmark, they will show up in
   the dropdown menu making it easier for other user to add them.


Every bookmark will contain a number of |asset| **assets**. These can be shots,
sequences, generic containers, etc. In technical terms, *assets* are simply
folders used to store texture, render, cache, scene or any other files.

.. note::

  All assets must have an *identifier file* in their root. Because we're using
  the Maya project structure as our base for assets this is a ``workspace.mel``
  file.

  When the *identifier file* resides in the root of a directory, GWBrowser will
  understand it as an *asset*, and the parent folder as a *bookmark*:

  .. code-block:: text

    ./SHOTS/ 	<- bookmark
    ├── SH000/
    │   ├── `workspace.mel`
    │   ├── scenes/
    │   ├── renders/
    │   └── textures/
    ├── SH010/
    │   ├── workspace.mel
    │   ├── scenes/
    │   ├── renders/
    │   └── textures/
    └── SH020/
        ├── workspace.mel
        ├── scenes/
        ├── renders/
        └── textures/


Annotating items
================

An important aspect of GWBrowser is to allow adding descriptions and thumbnails.

.. image:: _static/annotating1.gif

   :alt: Annotating items

.. note::
   Descriptions, thumbnails and comments are visible to everyone using the same
   server, as is marking an item **archived** |active|.

   Marking an item **favourite** |favourite|, however is local to the current
   user.



Assets & Files
==============

Adding assets
-------------

Select the ``assets`` tab and click the small add icon |add|, or press
``Ctrl+N`` to add a new asset.

.. image:: _static/assets.gif
  :target: _static/assets.gif
  :alt: Assets...

The created assets will be placed in the root of the currently activated bookmark
folder. If there's no active bookmark, you wont be able to add an asset.

.. tip::
   To activate an item, double-click it, or press enter when selected.


Archiving items
----------------

Much like bookmarks, assets can be annotated, marked as favourites or archived.
Because most pipelines are non-destructive deleting obsolete assets is not possible.
We can hide these items by clicking the small eye icon |active|.

  :target: _static/assets2.gif
  :alt: Assets...

.. tip::
   Marking something archived intended to mean the item is no longer used, eg.
   it is a depreciated shot or character rig. Marking a folder archived is only
   a visual garnish and in no way modifies the underlaying files.


Files and task folders
======================

Each |asset| **asset** contains a number of sub-folders, if you will, |folder|
**task folders**. As mentioned, these are the standard Maya project folders by
default, eg. `scenes`, `textures`, `caches`, etc.

At any one time GWBrowser will show the contents of one of the **task folders**.
We can switch between them by clicking the ``Files`` tab, or pressing
``Ctrl+3``.

Once the files are loaded you can interact with them as in other file managers.
Drag and drop is implemented.

  :alt: Sequences

.. tip::
  You can preview the selected items thumbnail by pressing the ``SPACE`` key
  on your keyboard.

.. tip::
  Clicking the little-folder icon will |folder| will reveal the file in the
  file explorer.

.. tip::
  Pressing ``Ctrl+C`` when an item is selected will copy its full path.

.. tip::
  If you need a path with forward or backslashes, or an URL, you can use
  **right-click -> Copy** options.



Sequences
---------

Sequentially numbered files will grouped into a single sequence. *Sequences* have their
own separate thumbnail and description independent of the individual items.

Use the little arrow button |group|, or press ``Ctrl+G`` to toggle sequence grouping.

.. note::
   GWBrowser will fetch *all* files inside the task-folder, including files in
   subfolders. Understandably, this process might take a while depending on the
   number of files. Be patient!

   It will also automatically generate thumbnails for image files. This can be
   turned off by clicking the little spin-icon.

.. tip::
   To refresh the list **right-click -> Refresh**, or press ``Ctrl+R``.


|filter| Filters
----------------

Because of how GWBrowser collects files the raw list can look intimidating.
For instance, the scenes folder had 100.000+ files in a recent job. Ouch.
Luckily we can isolate favourites, and use filters to hone in on the files
we are interested in.

Click the small file-icon |filter|, or press ``Ctrl+F`` to enter your filter.

.. image:: _static/files.gif
  :target: _static/files.gif
  :alt: Sequences

.. note::
   Filters operate on the full file-path, the description and the file
   information strings.


Filter examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Assuming the current *task folder* is set to ``scenes``, you can see all files in
the **scenes/animation** folder by simply typing:

.. code-block:: text

  animation

If you're a Maya animator, you can show Maya scene files by entering:

.. code-block:: text

  animation ma

In essence, any subfolder or file-name part becomes a keyword you can use for filtering.
If the animation folder has any subfolders, eg. ``take1``, ``take2``, etc., you
can enter...

.. code-block:: text

  animation take1 ma

...to show any Maya animation scenes of the specified take.


.. note::
   Filters are persistent and **unique to the current task-folder**.
   For each task-folder we can set a filter text - these will stay there until
   manually removed.
