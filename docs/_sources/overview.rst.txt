Why Bookmarks...?
=================

GWBrowser organizes projects into three parts: **bookmarks**, **assets** and
**files**. A bookmark is an entry-point to a project, whilst assets are
folders used to store scenes and render-files.

Depending on your role, and the project, you will likely
only need to interact with a specific part of the project. This is where
bookmarks come handy.

For instance, if you're a character modeller, some folders (eg. shots and
sequences) might not be of interest to you. You would then only bookmark the
folder where your model scenes reside and ignoring all the extra stuff you don't
care about that much.


Creating Jobs
=============

Before you can add a bookmark GWBrowser must be told where jobs are stored. You
can define a **primary**, **backup** and **local** paths.

Select the ``bookmarks`` tab (``Ctrl+1``) and click the small bookmark icon
|bookmark|, or press ``Ctrl+N``, to show the *add bookmarks window*.

If no jobs exist yet, you'll have to create one, otherwise, you can select an
existing one from the dropdown menu:

.. note::
  The first time a job is created **bookmark folders** won't contain any assets.
  Once at least one asset has been added to a bookmark folder, they will show up
  in the dropdown menu.

  See below to learn what constitutes a :ref:`bookmark folder<bookmark_folders>`.

The **server, asset** and **bookmark folder** selections make up the final
bookmark:

Creating Assets
===============

Every bookmark folder will contain a number of |asset| **assets**. These can be
shots, sequences, character assets, etc. In technical terms, *assets* are simply
folders used to store texture, render, cache, scene (or any other files).

.. _bookmark_folders:

.. code-block:: text

  ./SHOTS/                <--- bookmark folder
  ├── .browser            <--- GWBrowser settings and thumbnails
  ├── SH000/
  │   ├── workspace.mel
  │   ├── scenes/         <--- a task folder
  │   ├── renders/        <--- another task folder
  │   └── textures/       <--- and you guessed, a task folder!
  ├── SH010/
  │   ├── workspace.mel
  │   ├── scenes/
  │   ├── renders/
  │   └── textures/
  └── SH020/
      ├── workspace.mel   <--- identifier file
      ├── scenes/
      ├── renders/
      └── textures/

.. note::

  Assets have an *identifier file* in their root used by GWBrowser to find them.
  Because we're using the Maya project structure as reference this is a
  ``workspace.mel`` file.

  When the *identifier file* resides in the root of a directory, GWBrowser will
  understand it as an *asset*, and the parent folder as a *bookmark folder*.


To create a new asset, select the ``assets`` tab (``Ctrl+2``) and click the
small add icon |add|, or press ``Ctrl+N``.

The created asset will be placed in the root of the currently active bookmark
folder. If there's no active bookmark, you won't be able to add an asset.

.. tip::
   To activate a bookmark or asset, double-click it, or press enter when
   selected.


Customising the Job and Asset Templates
=======================================

The template files defining the job and asset folders are located in the
``[username]/Documents/GWBrowser`` folder on windows.

They are called **Asset.zip** and **Job.zip** respectively. You can replace them
with any other zip file (make sure to keep the same name).
