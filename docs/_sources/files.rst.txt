Task folders & files
====================

Each |asset| **asset** contains a number of |folder|
**task folders**. These are the standard Maya project folders by
default, eg. the `scenes`, `textures`, `caches`, etc. folders.

At any one time, GWBrowser will show the contents of **one** of the task
folders. To switch between them by clicking the ``Files`` tab, or press
``Ctrl+3``.

Once you make a selection, GWBrowser will load **all** the files found inside
the task-folder and its subdirectories. Understandably, this process might take
a while depending on the number of files. Be patient!

You can interact with the files by dragging and dropping them or double-clicking.

.. note::
  The files will **never** be moved, only copied.
  GWBrowser can't be used to rename, or remove files, only to browse them.

When dragging and dropping sequences we can decide which files to grab by pressing
the modifier keys **before** the items is dragged:

- Grabbing the **last** item of the sequence: ``Drag``
- Grabbing the **first** element of the sequence: ``Drag+Alt``
- Grabbing **all** elements: ``Drag+Shift``
- Grabbing the **parent folder**: ``Drag+Alt+Shift``

Locations
~~~~~~~~~

Clicking the little-folder icon |folder| or pressing ``Ctrl+O`` will reveal the
selection in the file explorer. Double-clicking a file will open it as it would
normally in the file-manager.

.. tip::
  Pressing ``Ctrl+C`` when an item is selected will copy its full path.

  If you need a path with forward or backslashes, or an URL, you can use
  **right-click -> Copy** options.


Sequences
---------

Sequentially numbered files will be grouped into **sequences**. Sequences
have their own separate thumbnail and description independent of the individual
items.

Use the little arrow button |group|, or press ``Ctrl+G`` to toggle between groupped
and individual items.


.. tip::
   To refresh the list **right-click -> Refresh**, or press ``Ctrl+R``.


Thumbnails
----------

Using the amazing `OpenImageIO <https://github.com/OpenImageIO/oiio>`_
GWBrowser will do it's best to create thumbnails for files it
understands. If you're experiencing any performance issues you can disable this
by clicking the little spinner icon or pressing ``Ctrl+M``.

Preview thumbnails by pressing the ``SPACE`` key. Use the ``arrow down`` and
``arrow up`` keys to step back and forwards.


Filters
=======

Because GWbrowser loads **all** files in a task-folder resulting list can look
intimidating. For instance, the scenes folder had 100.000+ files in a recent
job. Ouch. Luckily we can isolate items marked as favourites and hide obsolete
items.

You can also use filters to prune the asset and file list.
Click the small file-icon |filter|, or press ``Ctrl+F`` to edit the filter text.

.. note::
  Filters operate on the full file-path, the user-descriptions and the file
  information strings.

Filter examples
---------------

.. image:: _static/filters.png
  :alt: Filters

Assuming the current *task folder* is ``scenes``, you can show all files in
the **scenes/animation** folder by typing:

.. code-block:: python

  animation

If you're a Maya animator, and the animation folder contains animation scenes
from Cinema 4D you can show ``*.ma`` scene files by entering:

.. code-block:: python

  animation ma

or specifically hiding ``*.c4d`` files by entering

.. code-block:: python

   animation --c4d

In essence, any subfolder or file-name part becomes a keyword you can use for filtering.
If the animation folder has any subfolders, eg. ``take1``, ``take2``, etc., you
can enter...

.. code-block:: python

  animation take1 ma

...to show any Maya animation scenes of the specified take.


.. note::
   Filters are persistent and **unique to the current task-folder**, in the
   example above to ``scenes``.

   For each task-folder we can set a filter text - these will stay there until
   manually removed. This means if we were to switch to the ``renders`` task
   folder we would need to enter a new filter.


Further reading
===============

To customize GWBrowser refer to the API docs. I did my best to keep the modules
relatively well documented but it isn't perfect.
