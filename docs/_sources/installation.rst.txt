Installing From Source
######################

To build from source clone the repository from github:

.. code-block:: bash

  git clone https://github.com/wgergely/GWBrowser


Dependencies
------------

GWBrowser relies on a number libraries to function detailed below.
The code is written in Python 2. Python 3 has not yet been tested.


The Windows binary distributions were compiled against MSC v1900 (Microsoft
Visual Studio 14.0).


PySide2
~~~~~~~

GWBrowser was tested against ``Qt5.6`` and ``Qt5.12``.
You can get the ``PySide2`` from the official repository. Note that the last
official build supporting Python2.7 was ``Qt5.6``. The GWBrowser binary distribution
contains a home-built Python2 version of PySide2-Qt5.12.

.. code-block:: text

  http://download.qt.io/


.. code-block:: python

  from PySide2 import QtWidgets
  widget = QtWidgets.QWidget()


OpenImageIO
~~~~~~~~~~~

The python libraries to interface with ``OpenImageIO`` are imported
as follows:

.. code-block:: python

  import OpenImageIO.OpenImageIO as OpenImageIO
  buf = OpenImageIO.ImageBuf()

``OpenImageIO`` itself requires ``Numpy``.

Alembic
~~~~~~~

This is the standard python alembic library but GWBrowser imports it as
``GWAlembic`` to avoid name-clashes.

.. code-block:: python

   import gwalembic.alembic as alembic
   a = alembic.Abc.IArchive('C:/test.abc')


Scandir
~~~~~~~

This is a Python 2 compatible build of the Python 3 ``scandir`` module.

.. code-block:: python

   import gwbrowser.gwscandir as scandir
   scandir.walk(r'C:/test')


The module is embedded in GWBrowser (gwscandir.[pyd, so])
