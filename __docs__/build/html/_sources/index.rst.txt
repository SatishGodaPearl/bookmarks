Browser: Overview
=================

``Browser`` servers to be an easy-on-the-eye layer between the local project folder structure and us, the users.

The tool intends to make it easier to find project and render-files by grouping files and folders into three distinctive categories - bookmarks, assets and files - and by letting the user annotate and filter the collected information.

Code
====

``Browser`` is written in `PySide2` and thus can be embedded natively into packages which ship with PySide2. It comes with a standalone desktop version and an implemented Maya plug-in. My future hope is to add aid for Nuke, Houdini and Cinema4D if technologically feasible.

API
===

Below is the documentation for the Python modules.
